Character finder game.
My old university project. The task was to make an application which will generate random characters, with random size and color. The user have to find one specific symbol among them as fast as possible. 
In this application next features realised:
  - Random characters generation, with random postion on the right pad;
  - Target character appears on the small pad on left panel under seetings menu;
  - User can chose number of characters which will appear;
  - Pad's background color is white by default, but can be changed on the left panel, as well as characters size and color;
  - Stopwatch has delay, which allows user to check targeted character;
  - After user click targeted character, stopwatch stops and turns green.

  Default settings:

  Issues:
  - If custom settings applied font size HAVE to be set for normal work. Otherwise, they will be generated in in top right corner;
  - Sometimes symbols can go overlap border of container.

    
Installation: 
- clone repository;
- open `main.html` file.

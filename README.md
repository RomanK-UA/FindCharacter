My old university project.
The task was to make an application which will generate random characters, with random size and color. The user have to find one specific character among them as fast as possible. 
In this application next features realised:
  - Random characters generation, with random postion on the right pad;
  - Target character appears on the small pad on left panel under seetings menu;
  - User can chose number of characters which will appear;
  - Pad's background color is white by default, but can be changed on the left panel, as well as characters size and color;
  - If custom settings didn't apply, all characters will have random size (! if custom settings flag is turned on, characters size HAVE to be set for normal work);
  - Stopwatch has delay, which allows user to check targeted character;
  - After user click targeted characted, stopwatch stops and turns green.
    
Installation: download .zip and open index.html file.
